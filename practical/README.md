# GPT3 Practical

## TASK 1: 

1. Study the impact of GPT3 parameters on its Classification Accuracy  
   - Dataset: Twitter Sentiment Classification
   - Metrics: Plot accuracy Scores by varying parameters
2. Parameters are as follows:
   - Engine Type: Model options that can be used are Davinci, Babbage, Ada, and Curie.
   - Temperature: Amount of randomness to be introduced in the predictions of the model. Setting a higher value of
   temperature would be useful for creative applications whereas a lower value will be suitable for well defined answers.
   - Token Length: Maximum length of number of tokens accepted by the prompt.

## TASK 2:

1. Given an abstract of a research paper, determine the number of shots required to generate a title as similar as
possible to the actual title
2. Feed examples to GPT-3 through the API provided by OpenAI
3. Use BLEU Score to compare the predicted title with the ground truth
4. Comment on your learnings

## TASK 3:

1. Compare the performance of GPT3 with any fine-tuned Language Model
2. Use the Bahdinau_Attention fine-tuned model and solve the same using the GPT3
3Compare the metrics and results
